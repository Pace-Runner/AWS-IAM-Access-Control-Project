# AWS-IAM-Access-Control-Project
This project demonstrates hands-on experience with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), focusing on implementing the principle of least privilege through custom policies, user management, and permission testing. The project simulates a real-world scenario where development and production environments require different access levels.
